# TLDR

If you can try new things at work I think it's worth trying. It helps with typical routine work. Especially in my case where I work at my core project for 4.5 years (from beginning of it to maintenance stage). It also can help you gain new skills. You can learn for free from better developers at your company. You should start small if you are complete beginner (as I was in Java) but also you should ship something valuable. In my case doing work that nobody wants to do - small bugs on backend, test automation (we have only one full time automation engineer for 3 products) - helps with getting opportunities to work on things that I don't usually work.

# Why I started

Recently my project at work started to be more at maintenance stage than development. However for me as I interpreted it it's feels like opportunity than problem. First of all I started do some smaller work for other products. It was good information for me because I felt little stiff working more or less for most of time for one product for 4.5 years. Next new thing was little more hindrance for me because I got hint that I might write more automated tests. Sometimes I helped with that if that was needed but it isn't my favorite thing in the world. At first I treated it like inconvenience. Now however I think thats a good thing. I realized that I was working for image of person "to go to" for any topic even if it's thing that most people would feel that it isn't their cup of tea. As a frontend developer I sometimes wrote automated tests, configured kibana dashboards, created dashboard for performance tests or wrote full stack emergency app. Now I also started working with our backend which is written in Java (reactive spring boot).

# Why do something that nobody wants to do

Of course specialization is very important and there is also place for people which are very specialized in one topic. Nevertheless there is only small percentage of people for have guts and strength to get into level of specialization which is more valuable than regular senior developer. As I view it most of the time there is need for regular engineers who will do the work. And that is the person I now try to be. Doing job which is something that nobody wants to do is most of the time thing that is not your cup of tea. And thats good! You can learn something new and you can learn it and get paid for it. Most of the time when you do your side projects you learn something new but for free. Of course in job there is good chance that you have to learn something thats not in your interest zone but you don't know what you will need in some day. And when you do more and more things like that you can smuggle some things that you really want to do.

# Java as a tool, not a target

As an example of this thing - this year I'm trying to get my fullstack skills to next level and for that I'm trying to write more backend code. Firstly I took small optimalization task (don't call sql query if you know you don't have to. It was like 3 lines of code except that it took me whole day to find myself in code. I don't really know java and I always tell myself that I don't like it. Now I'm trying shift my mindset from closed to open and try despite that. Now I know that maybe I didn't like java because of my familarity of javascript. I just always tought that everything is easier in javascript.
