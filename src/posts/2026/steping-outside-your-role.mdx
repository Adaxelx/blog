# Why I started

Recently my project at work started to be more at maintenance stage than development. However for me as I interpreted it feels more like opportunity than problem. First of all I started do some smaller work for other products. It was good information for me because I felt little stiff working more or less for 4.5 years for one product. Next new thing was little more hindrance for me because I got hint that I might write more automated tests. Sometimes I helped with that if that was needed but it isn't my favorite thing in the world. At first I treated it like inconvenience. Now however I think thats a good thing. I realized that I was working for image of person "to go to" for any topic even if it's thing that most people would feel that it isn't their cup of tea. As a frontend developer I sometimes wrote automated tests, configured kibana dashboards, created dashboard for performance tests or wrote full stack emergency app. Now I also started working with our backend which is written in Java (reactive spring boot).

# Why do something that nobody wants to do

Of course specialization is very important and there is also place for people which are very specialized in one topic. Nevertheless there is only small percentage of people for have guts and strength to get into level of specialization which is more valuable than regular senior developer. As I view it most of the time there is need for regular engineers who will do the work. And that is the person I now try to be. Most often when you do this different little things you can learn something new and get paid for it. When you do your side projects you learn something new but for "free". Of course at job there is good chance that you have to learn something that's not in your interest zone but you don't know what you will need in some day. And when you do more and more things like that you can smuggle some things that you really want to do. Which is my next point.

# Java as a tool, not a target

As an example of this thing - this year I'm trying to get my fullstack skills to next level and for that I'm trying to write more backend code. Firstly I took small optimization task which was to not call sql query if you know you don't have to. It was like 3 lines of code except that it took me whole day to find myself in code. I don't really know java and I always tell myself that I don't like it. Now I'm trying shift my mindset from closed to open and try it despite that. I know that maybe I didn't like java because of my familiarity of javascript. I just always thought that everything is easier in javascript. Now I'm treating java as a tool for becoming better fullstack developer. When I see it that way I'm more open to learn it and use it and maybe I will like it (I think I will).

# Example how my work look basing on Sprint based timeline

In my case starting small worked and incrementally take bigger tasks. In course of 3 sprints it looked something like this. I tried to balance things that I have bigger value for now (automation) and things that I want to learn (smaller tasks that aren't that important now).

Sprint 1:

- Automation tasks (5 story points)
- Small backend optimization task and repo setup (3 story points)
  ...

Sprint 2:

- Slightly bigger backend task - bug but which low severity (3 story points)
- Automation tasks (3 story points)

Sprint 3:

- More important backend task - cost optimization by changing endpoint based on rest to queue (still relatively easy) (5 story points)
- Automation tasks (3 story points)
  ...

As you can see there is progression of tasks that are more and more complex. I could also lower automation tasks because now I'm more familiar with Java and I can provide more value for team. I also see change in perception of my work. I see that I'm getting more and more trust. This optimization task was given for me to do e2e - I'm creating API definition, backend code for that and then implementing frontend integration.
